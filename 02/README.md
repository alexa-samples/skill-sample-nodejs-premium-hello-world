Adding premium content to your skill is a way for you to monetize your skill.  This Alexa sample skill is a template for a basic ISP skill. It takes the hello world skill and adds greetings in a variety of languages as premium content. This premium content is accessed through a one-time purchase of the "Greetings Pack". It also includes a monthly "Premium Subscription", which greets the customer in multiple languages in a variety of voices using Amazon Polly.
