Adding premium content to your skill is a way for you to monetize your skill.  This Alexa sample skill is a template for a basic ISP skill. It takes the hello world skill and adds greetings in a variety of languages as premium content. In this first module this premium content is accessed through a one-time purchase of the "Greetings Pack". 

## What's covered
1. Deployment of an ISP product of type Entitlement via the ASK-CLI
2. Get a list of purchasable ISP products
3. Upsell and Buy directives (both request and response)
